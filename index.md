Climate change is pushing ecosystems beyond historical boundaries. Traditional conservation methods are no longer effective. Instead of resisting change, we should guide ecosystems towards desired outcomes. Assisted migration, the translocation of species to mimic range expansion under climate change, is a proposed strategy but faces controversy. Focusing on risks over benefits has hindered research and innovation in this area. Yet, the costs of inaction are too high and time is running out.

**FutureNature** is a project funded by the [European Research Council](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101076837), aiming to shape future functional ecosystems. we will approach the assisted migration of plant species from an innovative functional perspective, shifting the focus from minimising the impact of translocated species to maximising their contribution to the functioning of novel communities. To do so, the research team will study the contribution of non-invasive alien species to ecosystem functioning and test novel, simulated grassland communities in a climate change experiment. This knowledge will help create resilient ecosystems under climate change.

With the knowledge gained, we will be able to shape ecosystems that will not only survive, but thrive under climate change. **FutureNature** will provide a “greenprint” to study assisted migration across species groups and ecosystems, and, ideally, enable a paradigm shift in conservation thinking by lifting the psychological barriers preventing changes in natural ecosystems.
