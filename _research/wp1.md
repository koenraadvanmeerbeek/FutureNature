The field of invasion biology has traditionally concentrated on the most disruptive neophytes. However, many recent intentional and unintentional plant introductions have not led to invasions. This presents a significant, underexplored opportunity to better understand the role of neophytes within their recipient communities and to inform future assisted migration efforts. The primary objective of **Work Package** 1 is to draw insights from historical plant translocations to guide future assisted migration programs. It also aims to test the first hypothesis of FutureNature, which posits that neophytes play a crucial role in contemporary natural communities. This work package will leverage extensive existing databases to analyze the contribution of neophyte species to local biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.
