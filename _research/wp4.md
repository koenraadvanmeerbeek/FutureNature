**Work Package 4** encompasses all activities related to capacity building for assisted migration research and its practical implementation. Its significance lies in its supportive role, necessity, and potential for wide-reaching impact. The current scientific debate on assisted migration is largely shaped by anecdotes and opinions, with opposition often rooted in research on invasive neophytes. There is a pressing need to gather and effectively communicate robust evidence on the costs of inaction and the potential benefits of human interventions. 

The objective of this Work Package is to shift the risk-benefit perception of assisted migration as a biodiversity conservation strategy, encouraging further scientific research and the initiation of new assisted migration actions. To achieve this, we will formally identify knowledge gaps, influence both scientific and public discourse, and leverage insights from the previous Work Packages. Additionally, Work Package 4 will generate new results through collaboration and outreach, while ensuring the integration of the latest findings across all Work Packages.
