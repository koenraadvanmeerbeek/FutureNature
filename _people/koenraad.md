Prof. Koenraad Van Meerbeek serves as the Principal Investigator of the **FutureNature** project. He is an associate professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at KU Leuven. As the PI of the [sGlobe lab](https://www.sglobelab.com), his work focuses on developing robust solutions to address the biodiversity crisis, one of the defining challenges of the Anthropocene. His research employs a diverse array of methodologies, including fieldwork, long-term research platforms, drone technology, and computational modeling, to deepen our understanding of how global change affects biodiversity and the functioning of natural ecosystems. In 2022, he was awarded a prestigious ERC Starting Grant to support his FutureNature project, which aims to design future functional plant communities.
