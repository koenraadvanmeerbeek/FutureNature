Senne Spreij joined the **FutureNature** project and the [sGlobe lab](https://www.sglobelab.com) in 2024 after obtaining his degree in Bioscience Engineering at KU Leuven. During his masterâ€™s thesis, he studied the use of multispectral UAV imagery to identify invasive tree species in South African fynbos vegetation. As a PhD student, he investigates how functional assisted migration can be used as a nature management tool to maintain or recover ecosystem functions with a special focus on temperate grasslands in Europe.
